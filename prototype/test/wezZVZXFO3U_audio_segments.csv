2,at the Kraft kitchens we've created hundreds of cheesecake recipes over the years today I'm going to share some of our secrets for cheesecake success,3.57,10.8
3,let's start with our pan options,11.349999,13.129999999999999
4,you can use a regular 13 by 9 inch baking pan just line it with foil first forming it over the back of the pan so it fits in easily,13.469999,21.29
5,remember to leave a little extra foil on the ends to create handles,21.66,25.1
6,NON-SPEECH,25.1,32.759999
7,this step makes removing the Cheesecake a breeze,32.759999,35.699999000000005
8,you can also use a,36.07,36.97
9,springform pan for a round cheesecake the color of the pan you use affects your baking temperature,37.72,42.260000000000005
10,follow the direct temperature for shiny pans like this however dark pans and glass baking dishes absorb more heat,42.63,49.799999
11,so it's important to reduce the temperature by 25 degrees,50.139999,53.329999
12,classic cheesecakes use a honey made graham cracker crumb crust but you can use your favorite cookie crumbs,53.879999,59.339999999999996
13,NON-SPEECH,59.339999999999996,63.16
14,the key is to create an evenly packed crust it will make the Cheesecake easier to slice use a dry measure to press the crumbs firmly into the bottom of the pan,63.16,71.489999
15,NON-SPEECH,71.489999,75.93
16,when making your filling always start with room temperature ingredients an easy way to soften philadelphia cream cheese is in the microwave,75.93,82.78
17,simply unwrap and microwave on HIGH for 15 seconds per brick,83.2,87.19
18,another great tip is to make sure your batter is smooth and lump free before,87.77,91.54
19,the eggs,91.88,92.36
20,NON-SPEECH,92.36,95.24
21,add eggs one at a time beating on low speed just until blended,95.24,98.83
22,NON-SPEECH,98.83,107.639999
23,now be careful to not over mix the batter at this stage it'll incorporate too much air and lead to cracking,107.639999,113.32000000000001
24,NON-SPEECH,113.32000000000001,116.99
25,over baking is a common mistake and creates a dry texture when your cheesecake comes out of the oven the center should look slightly wet like this,116.99,124.349999
26,don't worry if it jiggles slightly it will continue to cook with the residual heat,124.82,129.1
27,if you're using a springform pan loosen the edges from the pan immediately,129.68,133.75
28,to prevent a soggy crust let your cheesecake cool completely on a rack at room temperature before refrigerating,134.3,139.959999
29,despite our best efforts sometimes cheesecakes do crack when this happens to me I just cover,140.38,145.629999
30,a garnish like Cool Whip whipped topping strawberry slices sour cream or pie filling it still tastes delicious,145.98,152.79
